# files_zenodo
Zenodo integration for ownCloud

Written 2016 by Lars NÃ¦sbye Christensen, DeIC

Allows you to send files in compressed form to Zenodo (zenodo.org), including metadata. 

## Dependencies 
 * The files_compress app for compressing into a tarball
 * ownCloud 7 or newer

## Installation instruction
Copy the app to the **owncloud/apps/** directory. Make sure the web server can write to the user directory - this is needed for temporary files.

## Usage

You will need a Zenodo access token in order to send anything to Zenodo. Go to zenodo.org to learn how to create one.
This token must be entered under your personal user settings in ownCloud - User-> AppSettings -> Zenodo.
