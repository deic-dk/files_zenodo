# files_zenodo
Zenodo integration for ownCloud

Written 2016 by Lars NÃ¦sbye Christensen, DeIC

Allows you to send files in compressed form to Zenodo (zenodo.org), including metadata. 

## Dependencies 
 * The **files_compress** app for compressing folders into a tarball
 * The **meta_data** app for using metadata tags
 * ownCloud 7.0.x (not tested with 8 or 9)

## Installation instructions
Copy the app files to the **owncloud/apps/** directory. Make sure the server can write to the user directory - this is needed for temporary files courtesy of the files_compress app.
